1. Installations:
pip install playwright
python -m playwright install

2. Playwright is more robust and avoids common issues like stale element references automatically.
3. Dynamic Locator Handling:Used page.locator to identify rows and the "Next" button. Playwright automatically handles dynamic elements better than Selenium.
4. .inner_text() to fetch the text content of elements.
5. page.wait_for_load_state("domcontentloaded") ensures the page is fully loaded after clicking "Next."
6. locator.nth(index) to iterate through rows and cells efficiently.
7. Playwright's locator does not use XPath selectors inside locator calls for children (like ./td[1]). Instead, Playwright uses CSS selectors for child locators, even if the parent locator is XPath-based.So,
replaced ./td[1] with td:nth-child(1)
Replaced ./td with td:
8. in Playwright, you can navigate from a child element to its parent using the locator.locator('..') syntax
Example:
# Locate a specific child element
    child = page.locator('text=Child 1')

    # Navigate to its parent
    parent = child.locator('..')

    parent = page.locator('text=Child Text').locator('..')

9. Playwright doesn't directly support Microsoft Edge as a separate entity, Edge uses the Chromium engine, so you launch it with the Chromium browser and point to the Edge executable.Ensure Edge is Installed.
with sync_playwright() as p:
    # Specify the path to the Microsoft Edge executable
    edge_path = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Edge\\Application\\msedge.exe"  # Adjust if installed elsewhere

    # Launch Edge browser
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False, channel="msedge")
    context = browser.new_context()
    page = context.new_page()

10. Playwright does not use a central configuration file like playwright.config.ts in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem. Instead, configurations are defined directly within the Python script or by using helper functions and custom modules to encapsulate settings.
Solution: define your configuration in a separate Python file (e.g., playwright_config.py) and import it into your test scripts.

Modularity:

You can store configuration details like base_url, browser type, headless mode, timeouts, and retries in a central file.
This makes it easier to reuse and update configurations across multiple scripts.
Dynamic Configuration:

Use Python's os.environ to allow environment-specific overrides for configurations (e.g., staging vs production URLs).
Customization:

Extend the config dictionary to include other test settings, like viewport_size, slow_mo, or proxy.

11. Parallel Execution: If you want to run tests concurrently, you can use Python's concurrent.futures or other parallel processing libraries.
Per-Browser Configuration: Modify the config file to allow custom settings for each browser, like viewport size, slow motion, etc.

Thread Safety: Playwright's sync_playwright context is thread-safe, so it works well with multithreading.

Parallelism: Use ProcessPoolExecutor instead of ThreadPoolExecutor for CPU-bound tasks. For I/O-bound tasks like Playwright, threads are more efficient.

Example:
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

# Define the test logic for a single browser
def run_test(browser_name):
<
>

# List of browsers to test
browsers = ["chromium", "firefox", "webkit"]

# Run the test concurrently on all browsers
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=len(browsers)) as executor:
    executor.map(run_test, browsers)
